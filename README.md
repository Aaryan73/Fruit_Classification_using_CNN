# Fruit_Classification_using_CNN
I used the Fruit 360 dataset hosted on the Kaggle website to classify fruit images into 131 different classes.
I was able to get 85% accuracy on the training set of data.

I made a similar model using feedforward neural network to get an idea about how CNN outperforms feedforward neural netowk. Using the feedforward neural network the best I could get is 61% accuracy.

Note:
Before running the notebook in you computer first make sure Anaconda Navigator is installed along with other required libraries.

To install the libraries just enter the command: 
pip install "library name" in command prompt or windown powershell.

Do tweak with different hyperparameters to increase the accuracy of the model.
